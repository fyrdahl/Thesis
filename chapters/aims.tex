\chap{Aims}
The overall aim of this thesis was to explore, evaluate, and develop potential methods using radial imaging. In particular, the golden angle and golden-angle-based sampling were evaluated for increasing the effectiveness of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging.

The specific aims for Study I-IV were
\begin{enumerate}[I.]
    \item To develop a methodology for golden angle radial imaging of pulmonary arteries, without breath-holding or intravenous contrast agents, and evaluate the potential improvement in image quality in healthy volunteers and patients with pulmonary embolism. 
    \item To design a generalization of the three-dimensional golden angle radial profile ordering to reduce the eddy current induce image artifacts in bSSFP MRI.
    \item To improve temporal resolution in golden angle radial phase-contrast CMR to enable diastolic dysfunction assessment.
    \item To design a three-dimensional sector-wise golden angle radial profile ordering that enables improved k-space uniformity after ECG binning.
\end{enumerate}
