\chap{Results}
In this chapter, the most important findings from the four studies will be highlighted. For the full results, see the individual studies.

\sect{Study I}
Study I was a proof-of-concept study to determine if a golden-angle based imaging approach could improve imaging of the pulmonary vasculature, in the context of imaging diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Diagnosis using MRI had previously been suggested~\cite{Stein2010, Kalb2012, Revel2013}, and in this study, the novel method was compared to a Cartesian free-breathing protocol with multiple repetitions~\cite{Nyren2017}. A number of encoding ordering strategies were tested, i.e. linear ordering, centric ordering, and golden-angle ordering. It was shown that the linear ordering caused the highest degree of image artifacts. The centric ordering scheme somewhat reduced the artifacts, but there was still a severe artifact obscuring the anatomy. Using the golden-angle profile ordering, the artifacts disappeared almost entirely. See figure~\ref{fig:study1_2}.

The golden-angle approach was evaluated using a sliding-window approach in two patients. A large thrombus was visible in the left pulmonary artery in both subjects. However, there is a clear difference in image quality between the Cartesian and golden-angle acquisitions. To quantify the difference in visibility, the blood-to-blood-clot-contrast was calculated and found to be 23\% higher for the golden-angle acquisition in both cases.

Two experienced observers were asked to score the image quality for the Cartesian and the golden-angle acquisition using three different temporal footprints. The results of the scoring are presented in Table~\ref{table:study1scores}.

\sect{Study II}
In study II, a modified 3D-radial double golden angle profile ordering was proposed to reduce eddy current artifacts. The proposed profile orderings showed a uniform behavior, in comparison to a completely random profile ordering, see Figure~\ref{fig:study2_1}, which was also confirmed by numerical calculations of the CCR-continuum.

There is an apparent uniformity to the golden, and tiny profile orderings, which is not present in the random distribution. This finding is corroborated by the CRR measure.}
    \label{fig:study2_1}
\end{figure}
One profile ordering, Tiny-13, was chosen for further testing. It was compared to the original double golden angle profile ordering~\cite{Chan2009}, by performing a simulated physiological binning based on pre-recorded ECG and respiratory signals. Binning was performed into 20 and 25 cardiac phases as well as 2, 4 and 6 respiratory bins. The profile ordering was calculated for all time frames for both profile orderings. Tiny-13 showed a higher degree of k-space uniformity in all cases except for 25 cardiac phases and 6 respiratory bins, where differences did not reach statistical significance.

\sect{Study III}
In Study III, a modified golden-angle phase contrast pulse sequence was proposed and evaluated for measurements of transmitral blood-flow and tissue velocities in patients. The PSF-analysis showed a higher sampling uniformity, and subsequently a lower peak PSF as a function of radius for the SWIG method compared to conventional golden-angle, see Figure~\ref{fig:study3_1}.

The pilot study showed that depending on the temporal footprint selected, CMR could either underestimate or overestimate the velocities compared to tissue Doppler echocardiography, see Figure~\ref{fig:study3_abstract}. It was clear that a smaller temporal footprint produced a sharper velocity peak, however, at the expense of increased noise, see Figure~\ref{fig:study3_2}. For a summary of the results from the pilot study, see Table~\ref{table:study3footprint}.

A temporal footprint between 27.2 ms and 40.8 ms did not differ when compared between CMR and tissue Doppler. Using larger footprints for CMR resulted in an apparent underestimation, whereas using a smaller temporal footprint resulted in an apparent overestimation of the tissues velocities compared to tissue Doppler (right).

The patient study showed a high degree of correlation for measurement of tissue velocities but a systematic underestimation of transmitral blood flow velocities, see Figure~\ref{fig:study3_3}. For a summary of all results from the patient study, see Table~\ref{table:study3summary}.

\sect{Study IV}
The result from the PSF-analysis showed that for high undersampling factors, i.e., 12 patches, there was a clear difference in the PSF between the double golden-angle profile ordering and the 3D-SWIG profile ordering. For 48 patches and 192 patches (R=1), the difference was less prominent, albeit with a slight edge to the 3D-SWIG profile ordering, see Figure~\ref{fig:study4_1}. For the three subjects, the k-space uniformity was significantly higher for SWIG-3D compared to the double golden-angle profile ordering, see Figure~\ref{fig:study4_2}.
